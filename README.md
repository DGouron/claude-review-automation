Automated AI code reviews powered by [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Assign a reviewer on your merge request — Claude reviews the code, tracks progress in real time, and follows up when you push fixes.

Works with **GitLab** and **GitHub** out of the box.

## Key Features

### Multi-Agent Reviews

Each review runs a configurable set of specialized audit agents — Clean Architecture, SOLID, Testing, DDD, Code Quality, and more. Define your own agents per project to match your team's standards.

```json
{
  "agents": [
    { "name": "clean-architecture", "displayName": "Clean Archi" },
    { "name": "security", "displayName": "Security" },
    { "name": "testing", "displayName": "Testing" }
  ]
}
```

### MCP Integration

A built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server gives Claude structured tools to report progress, manage review phases, and queue actions on discussion threads — replacing fragile text-marker parsing with typed tool calls.

| MCP Tool | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `get_workflow` | Read current review state and agent list |
| `start_agent` / `complete_agent` | Track per-agent progress |
| `set_phase` | Advance review phases |
| `get_threads` | Fetch MR/PR discussion threads |
| `add_action` | Queue thread actions (resolve, reply, comment) |

### Smart Queue

Powered by [p-queue](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-queue) with:

- **Concurrency control** — limit parallel reviews (default: 2)
- **Deduplication** — prevents duplicate reviews within a configurable time window
- **Graceful cancellation** — abort running reviews via dashboard or API
- **Memory guard** — auto-kills if RSS exceeds 4 GB
- **Retry on failure** — failed jobs clear deduplication so they can be re-triggered immediately

### Real-Time Dashboard

A WebSocket-powered dashboard shows live review progress:

- Phase and agent-level progress bars
- Running / queued / completed review counts
- Review history with duration, scores, and error details
- **Team tab** with developer cards, insights, and AI analysis
- **Stats section** with canvas charts, score trends, and animated counters
- Log stream for debugging
- Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff

### Developer & Team Insights

The dashboard computes performance insights from your review history — no configuration needed.

**Per-developer analysis** across 4 categories:

| Category | What it measures |
|----------|-----------------|
| Quality | Average score, blocking issues ratio |
| Responsiveness | Review turnaround time vs team average |
| Code Volume | Additions/deletions per review |
| Iteration | First-pass quality rate (reviews without blocking issues) |

Each developer gets a **level** (beginner → expert), a **trend** (improving / stable / declining), identified **strengths and weaknesses**, and a title based on their strongest category (Architect, Firefighter, Workhorse, Sentinel, or Balanced).

**Team-level analysis** shows top performer, most improved developer, and actionable tips.

**AI-powered narrative** (optional): click "Generate AI Insights" to have Claude produce a written analysis with per-developer and team recommendations.

Insights are computed from the first 5 reviews onward and persist across sessions.

### Follow-Up Reviews

When a developer pushes fixes after a review, Claude automatically:

1. Re-reads the discussion threads
2. Checks if blocking issues are resolved
3. Resolves threads on GitLab/GitHub
4. Posts a follow-up summary with updated score

This creates an iterative review loop, not just a one-shot check.

### Multi-Platform Support

| Feature | GitLab | GitHub |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Webhook trigger | Reviewer assigned | Review requested or `needs-review` label |
| Thread actions | Resolve, reply, comment | Resolve, reply, comment |
| Auto-followup | On MR push | On PR push |
| Authentication | `glab` CLI (OAuth) | `gh` CLI (OAuth) |

No API tokens needed — both platforms use secure CLI-based OAuth.

### Customizable Review Skills

Review behavior is defined by [Claude Code skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) — Markdown files in your project that tell Claude what to audit and how. Templates included for frontend, backend, and API reviews in English and French.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g reviewflow
```

### 2. Initialize

```bash
reviewflow init
```

The interactive wizard will:
- Configure server port and usernames
- Generate webhook secrets
- Scan your filesystem for git repositories
- Set up MCP server integration with Claude Code

For non-interactive setup: `reviewflow init --yes`

### 3. Start

```bash
reviewflow start
# Dashboard at http://localhost:3847
```

Then [configure a webhook](https://dgouron.github.io/review-flow/guide/quick-start) on your GitLab/GitHub project pointing to your server.

### Validate your setup

```bash
reviewflow validate
```

For detailed setup, see the **[Quick Start Guide](https://dgouron.github.io/review-flow/guide/quick-start)**.
